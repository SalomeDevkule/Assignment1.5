 Data is information in raw or unorganized form.
 Data is stored using databses or datawarehouses which are basically based on RDBMS.
 RDBMS works on structured data and cannot store data in the form of pictures, audio etc
Big Data is a high-volume, highvelocity, and high-variety information asset that demands cost-effective, innovative forms of information
processing for enhanced insight and decision making.
Bigdata works on any form of data using database management techniques other than RDBMS.
